        <bo>a) What is your Definition of experience?</bo>
        <p>My definition of experience is what I have done in my life, how I remembered this experience, and how it could help me in the future.</p>
    
    
    <wbr/>
    <p> <p/>
    <wbr/>

    
        <bo>b) Include two or three key experiences and how they have shaped you</bo>
    
        <p>One time that changed me a lot was in 2009, when I got bullied by the other kids in Preschool, and then stood up for myself in preschool.</p>
        <p>This changed me, because it made me find out that I have to stand up for myself when things start getting tough in life.</p>
    <wbr/>

        <p>Another time that changed me was in 2013 when I learnt how to do multiplication and division.</p>
        <p>This changed me, because it made me find out that I have a great sense of logical thinking and I can do much better if I am able to put my mind around things.<p/>
    <wbr/>

        <p>The last time that has changed me was when the COVID-19 pandemic hit, and I learnt new things.</p>
        <p>This changed me signifigantly, because it taught me how fragile the world is and how there are different ways to learn at home, thus opening my mind more to myself.</p>
    
    <wbr/>
    <p> </p>
    <wbr/>

    
        <bo>c) Based on your experiences, what career would you apply for?</bo>
    
        <p>I would be a Financial Analyst.</p>
    
    <wbr/>

    
        <bo>d) Explain why you would pick this job?</bo>
    
        <p>I picked this job, because a financial analyst has to go through lots of tough times like me in preschool,</p>
        <p>does a lot of difficult mathmatical calculations like me learning in 2013, and finally should understand how the world and markets are affected like me during the Pandemic.</p>
        <p>This is why I have chose to become a financial analyst for one of my future careers.</p>
