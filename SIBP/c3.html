        <bo>a) What is your definition of personality?</bo>
        <p>My definition of personality is how a person acts or behaves naturally by themselves and in different circumstances.</p>

        <wbr/>
        <p></p>
        <wbr/>

        <bo>b) Your personality Type and Code?</bo>
        <p>My personality type is protagonist and my code is ENFJ.</p>
        
        <wbr/>
        <p></p>
        <wbr/>

        <bo>c) What are some features of your personality type?</bo>
        <p>ENFJ's are strong extraverts and enjoy spending time with other people.</p>
        <p>ENFJ's have great people skills and are often described as warm, affectionate, and supportive.</p>
        <p>ENFJ's are great at encouraging other people and derive personal satisfaction from helping others.</p>
       
        <wbr/>
        <p></p>
        <wbr/>

        <bo>d) What are your three biggest strengths?</bo>
        <p>My biggest strengths are my ability to concentrate on things,</p>
        <p>my ability to work alone by myself and with others in changing times,</p>
        <p>my curiousity for other subjects and an ever growing will to learn more no matter what.</p>

        <wbr/>
        <p></p>
        <wbr/>

        <bo>e) What are your work habits and tendencies like?</bo>
        <p>I work in many different ways but mostly by myself, I also try to do my work using other skills such as coding,</p>
        <p>I also send all of my homework on or before deadlines and I have a great sense of imagination while working.</p>

        <wbr/>
        <p></p>
        <wbr/>

        <bo>f) Which career would you choose based on your personality?</bo>
        <p>I would be a pediatrician.</p>
        
        <wbr/>
        <p></p>
        <wbr/>

        <bo>g) Explain why you would pick this job?</bo>
        <p>I chose this job, because a pediatrician has to both work by themselves at times and at other times talk to their customer, like me with my group</p>
        <p>they also have to make sure to be organized and do all of their work on time and make sure they give the proper diagnosis for the customer, like me handing in work</p>
        <p>and they most importantly should understand how different medications work and how the medical field updates as time, like me with my great curiousity.</p>
        <wbr/>
