        <bo>a) What is your definition of skills?</bo>
        <p>My definition of skills is the ability to do something, especially if you can do it better than others.</p>

        <wbr/>
        <p></p>
        <wbr/>

        <bo>b) What are 3 skills you have?</bo>
        <p> My 3 skills I have are coding, mathematical thinking, and an extreme curiosity for learning.</p>
        
        <wbr/>
        <p></p>
        <wbr/>

        <bo>c) Which career would you choose based on your skills?</bo>
        <p>My career would be a programmer.</p>
        
        <wbr/>
        <p></p>
        <wbr/>
        
        <bo>d) Explain why you would pick this job?</bo>
        <p>I would be a programmer because a programmer needs to know one or more coding languages, such as Python, JavaScript and HTML,</p>
        <p>and they must be able to think critically about mathematical equations and should learn different skills quickly like how I mentioned before.</p>
