        <bo>a) What is your definition of intelligence?</bo>
        <p>My definition of intelligence is doing something with curiosity and great logic and finding out what it is that makes you intelligent</p>

        <wbr />
        <p> </p>
        <wbr />

        <bo>b) What are your top 2 intelligences?</bo>
        <p>My top 2 intelligences are logical mathematical intelligence and intrapersonal intelligence</p>

        <wbr />
        <p> </p>
        <wbr />

        <bo>c) Which career would you choose based on your intelligences?</bo>
        <p>My career would be a physicist</p>

        <wbr />
        <p> </p>
        <wbr />

        <bo>d) Explain why you would pick this job?</bo>
        <p>I chose this job, because a physicist would have to work by themselves and learn difficult mathematical equations</p>
        <p>which is quite similar to me when I am learning different things in school and other places.</p>
